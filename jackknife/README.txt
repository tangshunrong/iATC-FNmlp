To start jackknife test, unzip the "0.run.zip" file and run "1.run.bat" on windows. The mininum graph card requirement is 8GB.

After that you get "result.txt", the prediction original file, including 3883 14-D vectors for 3883 prediction results. Then copy "result.txt" to folder "1.val" and run "0.text process" and "1.result calculation" to validate.
